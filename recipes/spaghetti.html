        <img src="../recipes/spaghetti.jpg" alt="Image of spaghetti recipe" height="300" width="300">
        <h2>Description recipe</h2>
            <p>One-pot spaghetti puts Italian sausage, pasta sauce, and noodles together for a dish you <br>
                can have on the table in less than 45 minutes. It doesn't get much easier than this by <br>
                cooking everything in one pot. Switch it up by using ground beef, chicken, or turkey along <br>
                with any other of your favorite ingredients, such as sliced mushrooms.</p>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound ground Italian sausage</li>
                <li>1 small white onion, diced</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 (26 ounce) jar tomato-basil pasta sauce</li>
                <li>2 cups water</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
                <li>1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti noodles,<br> broken in half</li>
                <li>Â½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese for <br>serving (Optional)</li>
            </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
                    <p>Combine ground sausage, onions, and garlic in a large pot or skillet with tall sides. <br>
                    Cook over medium heat until sausage is cooked through, 5 to 8 minutes. <br>
                    Drain and discard grease.</p>
                <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
                    <p>Stir pasta sauce, water, and Italian seasoning into the pot; bring to a boil. Stir in <br>
                    spaghetti noodles, return to a boil, and cook, stirring occasionally, until noodles <br>
                    are cooked through and sauce has thickened, 17 to 20 minutes.</p> 
                <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
                    <p>Serve topped with grated Parmesan cheese.</p>
